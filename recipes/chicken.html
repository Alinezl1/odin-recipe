           </ul></li>
           <li><strong>Optional Spices/Seasonings:</strong>Paprika, Dried Thyme, Cardamom, or Cinnamon.</li>
           <li><strong>Garnish (Optional):</strong>Fresh Parsley or Cilantro</li>
        </ul>
         <h3>Steps:</h3>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, and a bit of turmeric. In a large skillet or pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown on all sides until golden. Remove the chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> In the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed. Sauté chopped onions until translucent, then add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Spices:</strong> Stir in the essential spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander) and any optional spices you're using. Cook for about 1 minute to toast the spices and enhance their flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Rice:</strong> Add the rice to the pot and stir well to coat the grains with the oil and spices. Cook for 1-2 minutes to lightly toast the rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Liquid:</strong> Pour in the chicken broth (or water) and bring to a boil. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Return the browned chicken pieces to the pot, nestling them into the rice. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Fluff:</strong> Once cooked, remove from heat and let it sit covered for about 5 minutes. Then fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
